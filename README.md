About the notebook 'Read_Visualize_Fits.ipynb'

It's a generic template notebook where you can put in a different source and ion and it will print the voigtfit results, show the fit results as plot, and point you to the data file that has the normalized flux, etc.

The .reg files essentially has all anyone would want, so it is a minimum data product to include for each fit. Then including the .hdf5 file adds more info, especially for anyone who uses voigtfit to be able to fully pick up where we left off, etc.
